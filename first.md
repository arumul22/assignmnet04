1.MERN :
MERN and MEAN are essentially identical, with the exception that React has replaced Angular. The primary advantages of utilizing MERN are the integration of React and its powerful library, as well as the possibility to use code on both servers and browsers at the same time. It also provides strong full-stack development (frontend and backend) capabilities. JavaScript, XML, and the Virtual DOM are all used in.React, and these components work together to implement changes.
React is a popular framework for constructing top-end single-page apps with interactive interfaces because to its flexibility and performance-oriented approach. The MERN technological stack is open source and has a large community behind it, as well as a robust set of testing tools. In 2021, it will rank as the second most popular web technology stack.

2. Mean :
Because of its numerous advantages, experts consider MEAN technology to be the finest for web development. MongoDB (a No SQL database), Express.js (a backend web framework), Angular (a front-end framework), and Node.js make up this framework,  which can be used to create complex mobile and responsive online apps (an open-source cross-platform server).
JavaScript is the only programming language utilized in this stack. It also includes a free module library and JSON-aware components that excel in data transport. This means that web developers can reuse this code across numerous projects rather than reinventing the wheel. Working with this web development technology stack requires only a basic understanding of JavaScript. The stack also aids in the development of software that is quick, efficient, and scalable.

3.Serverless technology stack :
Developing applications on cloud infrastructure is a popular web development trend these days, and if you want to do so, you may find it very handy. Thanks to the services and solutions provided by serverless computing platforms, infrastructure management has become simple.

With the serverless technology stack, scaling up to thousands of users quickly during spikes and then scaling back down when the surge passes is simple. Google App Engine, which debuted in 2008, was the first abstract platform to allow serverless computing. In 2014, AWS Lambda was launched.


4.Ruby on rails tech stack :
Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a web development framework for programmers. It's free and open-source, and it's created in Ruby, a dynamic programming language. RoR makes it simpler to design lightweight, flexible applications.
The stack uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces, as well as XML or JSON for data transmission. It enables the usage of default structures in web pages and database management. It also provides developers with a detailed error report that they may utilize to construct bug-free programs.

5.Flutter:
Flutter, a revolutionary web stack for cross-platform development, is the next web development technology on my list. Dart, the Flutter engine, the Foundation Library, and design-specific widgets are the main components. Flutter is an open-source software development platform that allows you to create apps for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Web, and Linux all from one codebase.
